//for example 

"slice" data type like "array" on GO but not equal :-)

var buf = make ([]int,0,10) //It is benefit for fast initialisation on GO!

//if you need to add "slice 2" to "slice 1" then using this constructions

var buf[]int
buf = append(buf,9,10)
buf = append(buf,12) //capacity = 4, but len(3)

otherBuf = make([]int,3)
buf = append(buf,otherBuf)
